  abstract = "A fundamental question in algorithmic mechanism design is whether
              any approximation algorithm for a single-parameter social-welfare
              maximization problem can be turned into a dominant-strategy
              truthful mechanism for the same problem (while preserving the
              approximation ratio up to a constant factor). A particularly
              desirable type of transformations---called black-box
              transformations---achieve the above goal by only accessing the
              approximation algorithm as a black box.",
